# csCSSc - Client-side CSS (De)Compressor

This tool is developed by datube and may be used online on
http://lacocina.nl/cscssc/css-compressor.html. The sources are
available at http://lacocina.nl/cscssc-git/.

The tool is a HTML-page with a Java-/ECMA-script file and serves the
following purposes:

- Compress CSS-code to save bandwidth by removing unnecessary
  white-space characters from CSS code 
- Decompress/pretty print CSS-code for readability and 
  maintainability of the CSS-code

  The typed or pasted CSS-code should be valid CSS Level 1 and/or 2
  code.


## Features of the compressor

Currently the script performs the following actions on valid CSS-code:

- Optionally, remove all comments
  All CSS comment-instructions can be removed, eg. everything between
  `/*` and `*/`.
- Remove unnecessary white-space
  All unnecessary white-space characters are removed. Additionaly,
  one may choose to remove all newline characters as well, resulting 
  in a single-line file.
- Remove unnecessary value-types
  When a value of a property equals `0` (zero), the compressor will
  remove type-declarations from the value, like `px` and `em`.
