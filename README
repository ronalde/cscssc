csCSSc - Client-side CSS (De)Compressor

This tool is developed by datube and may be used online on
http://lacocina.nl/cscssc/css-compressor.html. The sources are
available at http://lacocina.nl/cscssc-git/.

The tool is a HTML-page with a Java-/ECMA-script file and serves the
following purposes:

   - Compress CSS-code to save bandwidth by removing unnecessary
     white-space characters from CSS code 

   - Decompress/pretty print CSS-code for readability and 
     maintainability of the CSS-code

     The typed or pasted CSS-code should be valid CSS Level 1 and/or 2 
     code.



Features of the compressor

Currently the script performs the following actions on valid CSS-code:

   - Optionally, remove all comments
     All CSS comment-instructions can be removed, eg. everything between
     `/*' and `*/'.

   - Remove unnecessary white-space
     All unnecessary white-space characters are removed. Additionaly,
     one may choose to remove all newline characters as well, resulting 
     in a single-line file.

   - Remove unnecessary value-types
     When a value of a property equals `0' (zero), the compressor will
     remove type-declarations from the value, like `px' and `em'.
